# IBM_HR_Attrition_Prediction_System
IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the corporate world. In the corporate world, there is a common problem of employees leaving the the job after some extent of time by which the part of revenue and time spent on training the employess is wasted. To avoid this company want to build a prediction system which will analyze which employees will leave or if the company is hiring a new employee, on his past data the system will recognize that the employee will leave early or not.

I have addressed this problem and built a full fledged Survival Analysis and Prediction on HR Attrition System. You'll find the project in the jupyter file.
I have used scikit-learn libraries for machine learning and numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for DataFrame and Visualization.
