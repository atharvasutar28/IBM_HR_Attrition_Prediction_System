# IBM_HR_Attrition_Prediction_System
IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the corporate world. In the corporate world, there is a common problem of employees leaving the job after some amount of time by which the revenue and time spent on training the employees is wasted. To avoid this, the company wants to build a prediction system that will analyze which employees will leave or if the company is hiring a new employee, on his past data the system will recognize whether the employee will leave early or not.

I have addressed this problem and built a full-fledged Survival Analysis and Prediction on the HR Attrition System. I have used the Sci-kit-learn library for machine learning and Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for Analysis and Visualization. 

## Data Overview
The final dataset Attrition.csv dataset is created based on the IBM attrition dataset, with a few features added for the project, which included the Survival analysis and prediction of employee attrition.

## Tool -> Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
Step 1 -> Viewing the dataset info.

Step 2 -> Performing Data Visualization on various Key Performance Indicators to extract important trends and patterns.

Step 3 -> Analyzing missing values and deciding the columns needed for predictions.

Step 4 -> Transforming the data using the Label Encoding Technique and getting data ready for all the ML algorithms and predictions.

Step 5 -> Performing various ML algorithms to choose the right ML algorithm and extracting predictions for them.

### Key Performance Indicators
1. Gender: Contains the gender of the employee.
2. Overtime: Contains whether the employee used to do overtime or not.
3. Mode of work: Contains if the employee used to work from home or office.
4. Business Travel: Contains whether employees use travel frequently, rarely, or never.
5. Distance From Home: Contains the distance of the office from the employee's home.
6. Job Satisfaction: Contains the satisfaction level on a scale of 1-4.
