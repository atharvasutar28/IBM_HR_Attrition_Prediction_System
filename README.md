# IBM_HR_Attrition_Prediction_System
IBM is the largest industrial research organization in the corporate world. In the corporate world, there is a common problem of employees leaving the the job after some extent of time by which the part of revenue and time spent on training the employess is wasted. To avoid this company want to build a prediction system which will analyze which employees will leave or if the company is hiring a new employee, on his past data the system will recognize that the employee will leave early or not.

I have addressed this problem and built a full fledged Survival Analysis and Prediction on HR Attrition System. You'll find the project in the jupyter file.
I have used scikit-learn libraries for machine learning and numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for DataFrame and Visualization. 

## Data Overview
Final dataset Attrition.csv dataset is created based on the IBM attrition dataset, with a few features added for the project, which included the Survival analysis and prediction of an employee attrition.

## Tool -> Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
Step 1 -> Viewing the dataset info.
Step 2 -> Performing Data Visualization on various Key Performance Indicators to extract important trends and patterns.
Step 3 -> Analyzing missing values and diciding the columns needed for predictions.
Step 4 -> Tranforming the data using Label Encoding Technique and getting data ready for all the ML algorithms and predictions.
Step 5 -> Performing various ML algorithms to choose right ML algorithm and extracting predictions for them.

### Key Performance Indicators
1. Gender: Contains gender of the employee.
2. Overtime: Contains if the employee use to do overtime or not.
3. Mode of work: Contains if employee use to work from home or office.
4. Business Travel: Contains if employee use to travel frequently, rarely or never.
5. Distance From Home: Contains the distance of office from employee's home.
6. Job Satisfaction: Contains the satisfaction level on the scale of 1-4.

### Skills Acquired
1. Data Transformation
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization
4. ML Algorithms
5. Python
6. Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-learn
